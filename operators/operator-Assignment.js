// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS - COMMENTED OUT ALL OF THE ABOVE

let x = 10;
console.log(x);
// this.....
x++;
console.log(x);
// is th same as this.
x = x + 1;
console.log(x);

//but to increment by more than one at a time like this.
x = x + 5;
console.log(x);
// You can get the same result by doing this... 
// this uses the [addition operator] and the [assignment operator] "="
x += 5;
console.log(x);


// or use the [multiplication operator] and the [assignment operator] "="
x *= 3;
console.log(x);
