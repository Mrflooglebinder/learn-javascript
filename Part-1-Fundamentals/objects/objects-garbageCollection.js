// Objects: Garbage Collection

// in JS we don't have to worry about memory allocation and deallocation
// the JS engine has a garbage collector that automatically allocates memory when objects are created
// and deallocates memory when objects are no longer used
// you can't control the garbage collector - so we dont need to worry about memory management - Excellent!
